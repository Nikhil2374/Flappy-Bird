Flappy Bird Clone

Overview:
This project is a Flappy Bird clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the popular Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird, helping it navigate through gaps between moving obstacles.
The objective is to score as many points as possible by successfully passing through the gaps without hitting the obstacles or falling.

Features:
Simple Controls: Use a single button or key to make the bird "jump."
Randomized Obstacles: Obstacles appear at different heights, creating dynamic gameplay.
Score Counter: Tracks the player's score based on how many obstacles are successfully cleared.
Game Over Screen: Displays the final score and allows players to restart.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the game elements, such as the bird, pipes, and background.
CSS: Provides styling for the game's layout and animations.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including physics, collision detection, scoring, and user input handling.
